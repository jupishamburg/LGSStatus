This is a projekt of the youth organization Junge Piraten Hamburg (Young Pirates Hamburg).

In times of the Internet of things, we made made our branch office realize

* if it is open
* if the state of the office changes (open/closed) it will tweet about it
* how much heat is generated
* how many clients are connected to the local network

The whole project consists of three aspects:

* Arduino with photosensor
* Raspberry Pie
 * Posts all the relevant things to the webservice
 * Tweets all the things
* Webservice
 * stores all the data
 * has nice graphic representation of the aggregated data
